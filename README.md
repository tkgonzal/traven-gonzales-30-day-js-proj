# CSS Text Shadow Project
An iteration of the CSS Text Shadow Mouse Move Effect Project from Wes Bos's 30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge for Bay Valley Tech Module 2. Done with some changes to the implementation including new audio and styling changes that occur with other mouse events.

## Usage notes
